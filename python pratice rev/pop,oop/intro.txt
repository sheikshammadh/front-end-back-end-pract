====================================           ======================================
1.programs are devided into functions          1.programs are devided into objects
2.top down approach                            2.bottom up approach
3.no access specifiers                         3.provide access specifiers
4.no data security                             4.data security
5.no overloading concepts                      5.a.function overloading
                                                 b.method overloading
                                                 c.operator overloading


To solve real world entity we use oop.

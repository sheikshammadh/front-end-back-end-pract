function is a block of statements or block of code is called as function.
it performs the specific task only when it is called.
it is a reusable and can invoke as much times as you can.

functions are two types:
    A.Inbuilt functions(Inbuilt by the system)
    B.User defined functions(user given functions)

it has two parts:
    1.function definetion
    2.function call

1.function definetion:
   function name(the values are here are called as parameters)

2. function call:
   function name(the values are here are called as arguments)

*Arguments:
   when we dont know how many argumentsshould be passed then we can use "* arguments".this one argument 
can hold multiple values or data.

def shyam(*arguments):#(*Arguments) 
    return
print(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,90)

**keyword arguments:
    when we dont know how many arguments should we take. then we can use **keywordArguments.
def function(**keywordArguments):
    print(keywordArguments)
function(name="shyam", age=24, gender="male")

ex:
def greet(): #this is function defenetion
    print("hello")  these 3 lines are called as body
    print("hi")
    print("good")
greet()  # function call
greet()
greet().........invokes how many times we want.

ex2:
def add(a,b):
    return a+b

print(add(12,12))
==============================================================
nested funtion:
function within a function called as function

ex1:
def outer():
    print("outer")
    def inner("hello")
        print("inner)
    inner()
outer()

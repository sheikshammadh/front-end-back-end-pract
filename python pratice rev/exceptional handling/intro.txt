exceptional handling:
    interrupting normal execution of a code is called error (or) exception.
    we will handle by using error handling or exceptional handling.

when error occurs the python will normally stops the code and gives the error message.
the exception can be handled using the try system.

syntax:

try:
   risky code
except:
   print("error")
else:
   print("no error")
finally:
   print("always")

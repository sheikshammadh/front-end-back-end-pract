exceptional handling:
    interrupting normal execution of a code is called error (or) exception.
    we will handle by using error handling or exceptional handling.

when error occurs the python will normally stops the code and gives the error message.
the exception can be handled using the try system.

syntax:

try:
   risky code
except:
   print("error")
else:
   print("no error")
finally:
   print("always")

try:
   the try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
except:
   the except block lets you handle the error.
else:
   the else block lets you to execute code when there is no error.
finally:
   the finally block lets you ececute code regardless of the try and except blocks. 
   it always execute.

data types:
    a data type is a classification that specifies the type of data that a variable can hold. 
It determines the kind of operations that can be performed on the data and how the data is 
stored in memory.


1.int(numbers)                    list[] mutable||       frozenset
2.float(dec.numb)                 tuple()                none
3.boolean(true[1],false[0])       set{} ||mutable||      range        
4.string("text")                  dict{} ||mutable||     bites
5.complex(1[real],3j[imaginary])                         bytearray ||mutable||

Mutability:
    We can change the values or data by using some methods is called as Mutability.

inbult functions:
    input()
    print()
    type()
    id()
    min()
    len()
    map()
    filter()
    bin()
    oct()
    hex()

byte and bytearray:
    allowed range between 0 to 255

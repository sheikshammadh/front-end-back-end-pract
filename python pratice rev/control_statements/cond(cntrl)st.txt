Control flow statements:
    Control flow statements are used to determine the order in which instructions are executed in a program. 
They help control the flow of a program's execution based on certain conditions or loops.

examples for the pass, continue, and break statements in Python.

pass:
    The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes. It can be used as a placeholder
for future code or in situations where a statement is syntactically required but you don't want to execute any code.

continue:
The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration.

break:
The break statement exits the loop immediately, skipping all remaining iterations.

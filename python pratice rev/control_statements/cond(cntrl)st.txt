Control flow statements:
    Control flow statements are used to determine the order in which instructions are executed in a program. 
They help control the flow of a program's execution based on certain conditions or loops.

If Statement:
    The if statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is True, the code block under the if statement will 
execute.
Elif Statement:
    The elif (short for "else if") statement allows you to check multiple conditions after the if statement. If the if 
condition is False, the program will check the elif condition.
Else Statement:
    The else statement is used to execute a block of code if none of the preceding if or elif conditions are True.

For Loops:
    A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements. 
It iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects.
While Loops:
    A while loop repeats as long as a specified condition is True. It is used when you do not know in advance how many 
times you want to execute a block of statements.

examples for the pass, continue, and break statements in Python.
pass:
    The pass statement is a null operation; 
    nothing happens when it executes. It can be used as a placeholder  for future code or in situations where a 
statement is syntactically required but you don't want to execute any code.

continue:
The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration.

break:
    The break statement exits the loop immediately, skipping all remaining iterations.

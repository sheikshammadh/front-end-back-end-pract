when we dont know what statement or block of code is to be given then we can use jumping statements.
there are three(3) types of jumping statements:
they are:
      1.Pass
      2.Break
      3.Continue

1.Pass: 
    it is used when we dont know the block of code or statement which we want to execute.
if true:
    pass
else:
    pass
passes the iteration without errors.

2.Break:
    terminates the loop.
for "shyam":
if i=="y":
    break
print(i)
it breaks at the "y".
output as "sh",here stops at "y".

3.Continue:
    skips what ever we given
for i in "shyam":
   if i== "a":
      continue
    print(i)
it continues by skipping the given value.
output as "shym", here "a" is skipped.
